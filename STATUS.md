## Phase Status

### Phase 1: Project Setup - COMPLETED
- [x] Initialize project repository
- [x] Set up development environment
- [x] Install and configure PixiJS, Matter.js, and React
- [x] Create basic project structure
- [x] Set up placeholder assets for development
- [x] Set up build pipeline with bundling
- [x] Implement basic asset loading system

### Phase 2: Core Systems - IN PROGRESS
- [x] Implement rendering system with PixiJS
- [x] Set up physics engine with Matter.js
- [x] Create game loop architecture
- [x] Implement camera and viewport management
- [x] Build asset management system
- [x] Create input handling system (keyboard, touch)
- [ ] Develop simple debug visualization tools

### Phase 3: Basic Gameplay - IN PROGRESS
- [x] Implement cow character with basic movement
- [x] Create launch mechanism (power/angle controls)
- [x] Implement basic collision detection
- [x] Add simple terrain generation
- [x] Create basic scoring system
- [x] Implement game state management
- [x] Build basic UI elements (power meter, angle indicator)

### Phase 4: Expanded Gameplay - NOT STARTED
### Phase 5: UI and Menus - PARTIALLY STARTED
- [x] Create main menu
- [ ] Implement terrain selection screen
- [ ] Add settings menu with options
- [ ] Create pause menu
- [x] Implement game over screen
- [ ] Add basic leaderboard functionality
- [ ] Build achievement system

### Phase 6: Visual Polish - NOT STARTED
### Phase 7: Testing and Optimization - PARTIALLY STARTED
- [x] Implement error handling for asset loading
- [x] Add fallback systems for fonts and assets
- [ ] Performance profiling and optimization
- [ ] Memory usage analysis and fixes
- [ ] Cross-browser testing
- [ ] Mobile device testing
- [ ] Implement analytics tracking

### Phase 8: Final Polish and Launch - NOT STARTED

## Recent Achievements
- Created project structure and architecture
- Implemented core game systems (physics, rendering, input)
- Created basic gameplay mechanics (launch, terrain, scoring)
- Implemented UI components (power meter, angle indicator, score display)
- Set up game loop and state management
- Generated placeholder assets for development
- Fixed asset loading issues with spritesheets by implementing workarounds
- Implemented font fallbacks and improved font loading resilience

## Blockers/Issues
- ~~Spritesheet loading errors~~ - FIXED: Implemented workaround using SVG images and simplified texture handling
- ~~Font loading errors~~ - FIXED: Created more realistic placeholder font files and added font fallbacks in CSS
- Need to implement mobile-friendly controls
- Need to add more interactive elements to gameplay

## Next Steps
1. Complete core gameplay mechanics
2. Implement additional game elements (trampolines, obstacles)
3. Add visual polish and effects
4. Create proper terrain generation with multiple biomes
5. Test game on different devices and browsers

## Notes
- Current implementation focuses on core gameplay mechanics
- UI is functional but needs visual improvement
- Physics implementation is basic and needs fine-tuning
- Placeholder assets are in place with simplified asset loading
- Font system now properly handles fallback fonts when custom fonts fail to load
