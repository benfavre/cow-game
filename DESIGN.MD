### 🎨 **Design Style Plan** – *Cow Launchers United!*

---

## 🐄 1. **Visual Identity & Theme**

### ✨ **Art Style**
- **Style:** 2D cartoon, bold outlines, simple but expressive shapes.

- **Color Palette:**
  - **Primary Colors:** Sky Blue, Pasture Green, Sunny Yellow
  - **Accent Colors:** Bubblegum Pink, Creamy White (for cow), Mud Brown (for obstacles)
  - **Weather Variations:** Subtle overlays (light blue for rain, white for snow, yellow-orange for thunder)

### 🐮 **Character Design**
- **Main Cow:**
  - Big goofy eyes, a flappy tongue, expressive animations (happy, dizzy, shocked).
  - Accessories tied to power-ups (wings, capes, helmets).
- **Other Characters:**
  - Birds, squirrels, or sheep as background critters or NPCs.

## 🌳 2. **Environment & Level Design**

### 🏞 **Landscape**
- **Ground:** Rolling green hills with occasional barns, fences, and flowers.
- **Sky:** Dynamic layers for parallax (clouds, sun, stars depending on time/weather).
- **Trampolines:** Vibrant colors with spring animations, "boing" sound FX.

### 🌦 **Weather FX**
- **Wind:** Visual gusts with particle effects.
- **Rain:** Animated droplets and splash effects.
- **Snow:** Soft falling flakes, cow leaves trails.
- **Thunder:** Flash overlays and screen shake.

## 🛠️ 3. **UI/UX Design**

### 🕹️ **Main HUD**
- Power Meter (charging via spacebar): Bright meter bar with cow face indicator.
- Angle Indicator: Simple arc with arrow showing launch angle.
- Score Tracker: Fun, bubble-letter numbers with coin, combo, and distance counters.
- Power-up Icons: Display active buffs with time remaining.

### 🏁 **Menus**
- **Main Menu:**
  - Big "LAUNCH!" button with bouncing cow animation.
  - Buttons styled like hay bales, barns, and road signs.
- **Pause Menu:**
  - Sketchbook or chalkboard style.
  - Icons for Resume, Restart, Settings with silly animations (e.g., cow chewing pause icon).

## 💫 4. **Animations & Effects**

### 🐄 **Cow Animations**
- **Idle:** Cow blinks, wobbles, shifts weight.
- **Launch:** Stretch-squash animation, mid-air spinning/flipping.
- **Landing:** Bounces, splats, or slides depending on surface.
- **Trick Combos:** Trail effects with stars or rainbows.

### 🧃 **Power-ups**
- Each with unique pickup animation and VFX:
  - **Wings:** Flapping feather burst
  - **Magnet:** Metal sparkle and item vacuum lines
  - **Time Slow:** Clock icon with warpy screen blur

## 🎶 5. **Audio Design**

### 🎧 **Music**
- Upbeat, funky country + cartoon vibes.
- Varies by weather and speed (dynamic layering).

### 🔊 **Sound Effects**
- "Boing" from trampolines
- "Moo" mid-air
- Comedic whooshes, flops, and coin pickups
- Power-ups trigger energetic jingles

---

## 🧪 6. **Procedural Generation Visuals**

- Seamlessly blend terrain tiles for variety (fields, mud patches, mini hills).
- Use prefab chunks: e.g., "Barn + Rock", "Hill + Trampoline", "Pond + Tree".
- Keep visuals looping subtly to feel endless without repetition.
