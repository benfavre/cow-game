## Development Guidelines

### Code Structure
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Follow object-oriented design principles
- Implement component-based architecture
- Use state management for game data
- Keep rendering and logic separate
- Use event system for communication

### Performance Considerations
- Implement object pooling for frequently created/destroyed objects
- Use sprite batching for optimal rendering
- Implement culling for off-screen objects
- Optimize physics calculations
- Use asset compression and optimization
- Implement progressive loading

### Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for core systems
- Integration tests for game mechanics
- Performance benchmarks
- Playtesting sessions with feedback forms
- Automated UI testing
